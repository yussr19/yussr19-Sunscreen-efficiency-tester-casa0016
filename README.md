This project is designed to meausre how well suncreens work at blocking UV light. 
This project uses a photo transistor and a 400nm UV LED with a glass microscpoe in between , as the UV light is lit through a microscope slide covered with sunscreen to measure how much UV light is blocked. This is comapred to the basline of a clear microscope slide , the result is then displayed on an LCD which shows the percentage of UV that is blocked in real time.
