This project is a simple UV sensing device that helps visualise how well sunscreen blocks ultraviolet (UVA) light. By shining UV light through a microscope slide and measuring how much passes through, the system provides immediate feedback on sunscreen effectiveness.

The goal is to make UV protection more visible and intuitive, showing how different products and application thicknesses affect UV exposure.

#  How It Works #

A UV LED shines light through a microscope slide

A phototransistor detects how much UV passes through

A clean slide is used as a baseline reference

Sunscreen is applied to the slide to reduce transmitted UV

An Arduino calculates the percentage of UV blocked

Results are displayed in real time on an LCD screen

The system compares measurements relative to the baseline, rather than measuring absolute UV intensity.

 #  Main Components

Arduino MKR WiFi 1310

400 nm UV LED

UV-sensitive phototransistor

16×2 RGB LCD

Resistors, breadboard, microscope slides

 # 📊 What It Shows

Sunscreen significantly reduces UV transmission

Thicker applications block more UV

Different sunscreen products perform differently

#  Limitations & Future Ideas

Single UV wavelength (UVA only)

Sensitive to alignment and ambient light

Possible improvements include optical shielding, multi-wavelength testing, and enhanced visualisation.

 #  AI Use

AI tools were used to assist with code debugging and writing clarity. All testing and analysis were performed by the author.
